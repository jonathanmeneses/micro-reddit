# README

## Overview
This is a repostiory for a ["Micro Reddit" project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-micro-reddit) built using Rails as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) criteria. It's meant to build and test an understanding of models, validations, and associations as part of Rails' Active Record gem. 

## Technologies Used
- Ruby 3.x
- Rails 7.x
- SQLite3

## Features
- **User Management:** Users can sign up with a unique username and email.
- **Post Creation:** Users can create posts with titles and optional links.
- **Comments:** Users can comment on posts, showcasing the associations between users, posts, and comments.

## How to Use
It's not recommended to clone this yourself, but rather, follow the instructions in The Odin Project to build this yourself! It was a great exercise, and I feel much more confident in my understanding of Active Record after doing so.
